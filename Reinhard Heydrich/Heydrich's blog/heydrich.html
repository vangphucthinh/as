            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich was born in 1904 in Halle an der Saale to composer and opera singer Richard Bruno Heydrich and his 
                wife, Elisabeth Anna Maria Amalia Heydrich (née Krantz).
            </p>
            <p>The Heydrich household was strict. As a youth, he engaged his younger brother, Heinz, in mock fencing duels.
                 He excelled in his schoolwork—especially in science—at the "Reformgymnasium"
                </p>
            <p>A talented athlete, he became an expert swimmer and fencer. 
                He was shy, insecure, and was frequently bullied for his high-pitched voice and rumoured Jewish ancestry.
            </p>
            <p>In 1918, World War I ended with Germany's defeat. In late February 1919, civil unrest—including strikes and clashes between 
                communist and anti-communist groups—took place in Heydrich's home town of Halle.
            </p>
            <p>Heydrich, then 15 years old, joined Maercker's Volunteer Rifles (a paramilitary Freikorps unit). When the skirmishes ended, Heydrich 
                was part of the force assigned to protect private property.
            </p>
            <p>Little is known about his role, but the events left a strong impression; it was a "political awakening" for him. 
                He joined the National German Protection and Shelter League, an anti-Semitic organisation.
            </p>
            <p>As a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. 
                Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople there could afford a musical education at Bruno Heydrich's conservatory. 
                This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>His grown-up</h2>
            <p>In 1922, Heydrich joined the German Navy (Reichsmarine), taking advantage of the security, structure, and pension it offered. 
                He became a naval cadet at Kiel, Germany's primary naval base.
            </p>
            <p>On 1 April 1924 he was promoted to senior midshipman and sent to officer training at the Naval Academy Mürwik.</p>
            <p>In 1926 he advanced to the rank of ensign and was assigned as a signals officer on the battleship SMS Schleswig-Holstein, the flagship of Germany's North Sea Fleet.
                He received good evaluations from his superiors and had few problems with other crewmen. 
                He was promoted on 1 July 1928 to the rank of sub-lieutenant. The increased rank fuelled his ambition and arrogance.
            </p>
            <p>In December 1930 he attended a rowing-club ball and met Lina von Osten. 
                They became romantically involved and soon announced their engagement. 
                Lina was already a Nazi Party follower; she had attended her first rally in 1929.
            </p>
            <p>In 1931 Heydrich was charged with "conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman" for breaking an engagement promise to a woman 
                he had known for six months before the von Osten engagement. Admiral Erich Raeder dismissed Heydrich from the navy that April. 
                He received severance pay of 200 Reichsmarks (equivalent to €640 in 2009) a month for the next two years.
                Heydrich married Lina in December 1931.

    <section id="In-SS">
        <div class="text">
            <h2>In SS</h2>
            <p>On 30 May 1931, Heydrich's discharge from the navy became legally binding, and either the following day or on 1 June he joined the Nazi Party in Hamburg.
                Six weeks later, on 14 July, he joined the SS. His Party number was 544,916 and his SS number was 10,120. Those who joined the Party after Hitler's seizure of power in January 1933 faced suspicions from the Alte Kämpfer (Old Fighters; the earliest party members) 
                that they had joined for reasons of career advancement rather than a true commitment to the National Socialist program. Heydrich's date of enlistment in 1931 was early enough to quell suspicion that he had only joined to further his career,
                but was not early enough for him to be considered an Old Fighter.
            </p>
            <p>In 1931, Heinrich Himmler began setting up a counterintelligence division of the SS. Acting on the advice of his associate Karl von Eberstein, who was Lina's friend, Himmler agreed to interview Heydrich, 
                but cancelled their appointment at the last minute.
            </p>
            <p>Lina ignored this message, packed Heydrich's suitcase, and sent him to Munich. Eberstein met Heydrich at the railway station and took him to see Himmler.
                Himmler asked Heydrich to convey his ideas for developing an SS intelligence service. Himmler was so impressed that he hired Heydrich immediately.
            </p>
            <p>Although the starting monthly salary of 180 Reichsmarks (the equivalent of US$40) (equivalent to €576 in 2009) was low, Heydrich decided to take the job because Lina's family supported the Nazi movement, 
                and the quasi-military and revolutionary nature of the post appealed to him. At first he had to share an office and typewriter with a colleague, but by 1932 Heydrich was earning 290 Reichsmarks a month (equivalent to €1,009 in 2009), 
                a salary he described as "comfortable".  As his power and influence grew throughout the 1930s, his wealth grew commensurately;
                in 1935 he received a base salary of 8,400 Reichsmarks (equivalent to €32,854 in 2009) and an allowance of 12,000 Reichsmarks (equivalent to €46,934 in 2009) 
                and by 1938 his income increased to 17,371 Reichsmarks (equivalent to €65,749 in 2009), annually. Heydrich later received a Totenkopfring from Himmler for his
                SS service.
            </p>
            <p>On 1 August 1931, Heydrich began his job as chief of the new 'Ic Service' (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich. By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering 
                purposes and to obtain information to be used as blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards
                and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrich's December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer (major).

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Gestapo and SD</h2>    
            <p>In mid-1932, Himmler appointed Heydrich chief of the renamed security service—the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Heydrich's counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and intimidation.
                With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states.
                They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. 
                Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.
            </p>
            <p>In 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, and through a series of decrees became Germany's Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor). The first concentration camps, which were originally intended to house political opponents, 
                were established in early 1933. By year's end there were over fifty camps.</p>
            <p>Hermann Göring founded the Gestapo in 1933 as a Prussian police force. When Göring transferred full authority over the Gestapo to Himmler in April 1934, it immediately became an instrument of terror under the SS's purview.
                Himmler named Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. On 9 June 1934, Rudolf Hess declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service.

    <section id="Czechoslovakia">
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Czechoslovakia</h2>
            <p>On 27 September 1941, Heydrich was appointed Deputy Reich Protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the part of Czechoslovakia incorporated into the Reich on 15 March 1939) and assumed control 
                of the territory. The Reich Protector, Konstantin von Neurath, remained the territory's titular head, but was sent on "leave" because Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich felt his "soft approach" to the Czechs 
                had promoted anti-German sentiment and encouraged anti-German resistance via strikes and sabotage. Upon his appointment, Heydrich told his aides: "We will Germanize the Czech vermin."
            </p>
            <p>Heydrich came to Prague to enforce policy, fight resistance to the Nazi regime, and keep up production quotas of Czech motors and arms that were "extremely important to the German war effort".
                He viewed the area as a bulwark of Germandom and condemned the Czech resistance's "stabs in the back". To realise his goals, Heydrich demanded racial classification of those who could and could not be Germanized. He explained, "Making this Czech garbage into Germans must give way to methods based on racist thought."
                Heydrich started his rule by terrorising the population: he proclaimed martial law, and 142 people were executed within five days of his arrival in Prague. Their names appeared on posters throughout the occupied country. Most of them were the members of the resistance that had previously been captured and were awaiting trial.
            </p>
            <p>As Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich applied carrot-and-stick methods. Labour was reorganised on the basis of the German Labour Front. Heydrich used equipment confiscated from the Czech organisation Sokol to organise events for workers.
                Food rations and free shoes were distributed, pensions were increased, and (for a time) free Saturdays were introduced. Unemployment insurance was established for the first time. The black market was suppressed. Those associated with it or the resistance movement were tortured or executed. Heydrich labelled them "economic criminals" and "enemies of the people", which helped gain him support. 
                Conditions in Prague and the rest of the Czech lands were relatively peaceful under Heydrich, and industrial output increased. Still, those measures could not hide shortages and increasing inflation; reports of growing discontent multiplied.
            </p>
            <p>Heydrich was, for all intents and purposes, military dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone in a car with an open roof – 
                a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>By 3 October 1941, Czechoslovak military intelligence in London had made the decision to kill Heydrich.</p>

    <section id="Death">
        <div class="text">        
            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>In London, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile resolved to kill Heydrich. Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík headed the team chosen for the operation, 
                trained by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). They returned to the Protectorate, parachuting from a Handley Page Halifax on 28 December 1941, where they lived in hiding, preparing for the mission.
            </p>
            <p>On 27 May 1942, Heydrich planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction in the Prague suburb of Libeň was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend.
                As Heydrich's car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Heydrich ordered his driver Klein to halt and attempted to confront the attackers, rather than having his driver speed away.
                Kubiš then threw a converted anti-tank mine at the rear of the car as it stopped. The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš. Heydrich ordered Klein to chase Gabčík on foot, and Gabčík shot Klein in the leg. Kubiš and Gabčík managed to escape the scene.
            </p>
            <p>A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a delivery van. He was placed in the back of the van on his stomach and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital.
                He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one lung. A splenectomy was performed, and the chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided.
                Himmler ordered Karl Gebhardt to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrich's recovery appeared to progress well. Hitler's personal doctor Theodor Morell suggested the use of the new antibacterial drug sulfonamide, but Gebhardt thought that Heydrich would recover and declined the suggestion.
                On June 2, Himmler went to visit him. After the vistit, Heydrich slipped into a coma and never regained consciousness. He died on 4 June; an autopsy concluded that he died of sepsis.
